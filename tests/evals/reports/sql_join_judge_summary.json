While it correctly identifies that joins are required and gets the basic customer-orders relationship right, it misses the critical order_details table that typically exists in normalized database schemas, uses incomplete join type notation, and creates a direct orders-products relationship that may not exist in standard e-commerce database designs. The response shows partial competence but lacks the completeness and accuracy needed for proper SQL join inference."
